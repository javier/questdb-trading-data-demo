    "# Example: Ingesting Digital Assets Data with a Third-Party Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "[CryptoFeed](https://github.com/bmoscon/cryptofeed) is an open-source library for retrieving data from multiple digital asset exchange feeds and storing it in a high-performance database. One of its supported backends is QuestDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’ll capture trade data for the symbols `ADA-USDT`, `BTC-USDT`, `ETH-BTC`, and `ETH-USDT` from [OKX](https://www.okx.com/), and store it in QuestDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since CryptoFeed handles the entire ingestion process, you only need to point it to the QuestDB TCP socket (which defaults to port 9009). The library will take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start the notebook, it will begin capturing data continuously until you either stop the execution or close the browser tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is the same one powering the public demo at `https://demo.questdb.io`, with the only difference being that the demo machine tracks 32 symbols instead of just four.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script below processes each message and stores it in a table named `trades` in QuestDB. If the table doesn’t exist, it will be automatically created on the first write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE 'trades' (\n",
    "\tsymbol SYMBOL CAPACITY 256 CACHE,\n",
    "\tside SYMBOL CAPACITY 256 CACHE,\n",
    "\tprice DOUBLE,\n",
    "\tamount DOUBLE,\n",
    "\ttimestamp TIMESTAMP\n",
    ") timestamp(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY WAL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the live data in your database, open a new browser tab and navigate to `http://localhost:9000`. You can run a basic query like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM trades -10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to see the latest 10 trades. For something more insightful, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT timestamp, symbol, side, sum(price * amount)\n",
    "FROM trades\n",
    "SAMPLE BY 1m;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you trade volume totals per symbol at 1-minute intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more realistic queries, open the [Examples-of-market-data-queries notebook](/notebooks/Examples-of-market-data-queries.ipynb) in a new tab. It includes adapted queries from the demo environment that should return meaningful results on your local dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize your live data in real time, we offer a sample dashboard powered by Grafana and another one powered by Pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see the Grafana dashboard navigate to the [demo Grafana dashboard](http://localhost:3000/d/live-trades-demo/live-trades-demo). The user is `admin` and the password is `quest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see your live data on a Pulse dashboard, please navigate in a new tab to [the demo Pulse dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dash/29/Live%20Trades%20Demo).\n"
