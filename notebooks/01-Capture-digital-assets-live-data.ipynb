    "# Example of ingesting cryptocurrency data with a third party integration\n",
    "\n",
    "[CryptoFeed](https://github.com/bmoscon/cryptofeed) is an open source library to get data from multiple cryptocurrency exchange datafeeds and store the data in a fast database. One of the supported databases to store the data is QuestDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will get trades for the symbols `ADA-USDT`, `BTC-USDT`, `ETH-BTC`, and `ETH-USDT` from [OKX](https://www.okx.com/) and will store them in QuestDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the CryptoFeed library takes care of everything, we only need to point it to the QuestDB TCP socket connection (which defaults to port 9009) and the library will take care of everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start the notebook, it will start capturing data continuously until you stop it or until you close this tab on your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is the same that is powering the demo at `https://demo.questdb.io`, with the only difference that the demo machine is tracking 32 symbols, rather than only four. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script below processes each message and it stores it\n",
    "on QuestDB, in a table named `trades`, with the schema below. If table does not exist, it will be automatically created on the first write.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE 'trades' ( \n",
    "\tsymbol SYMBOL CAPACITY 256 CACHE,\n",
    "\tside SYMBOL CAPACITY 256 CACHE,\n",
    "\tprice DOUBLE,\n",
    "\tamount DOUBLE,\n",
    "\ttimestamp TIMESTAMP\n",
    ") timestamp(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY WAL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the live data on your database, you can open a new tab on your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000`. You can then execute a simple query like `SELECT * FROM trades -10;` to see the latest 10 trades. Or you could execute a sligthly more sophisticated query like `select timestamp, symbol, side, sum(price * amount) from trades sample by 1m ` to get the totals for each symbol at 1 minute intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more realistic queries, please open in a new tab the [Examples-of-market-data-queries notebook](/notebooks/Examples-of-market-data-queries.ipynb), where you will find some queries adapted from the demo machine that should return results for your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see your live data on a real-time dashboard, please navigate in a new tab to [the demo dashboard](http://localhost:3000/d/live-trades-demo/live-trades-demo) powered by Grafana. The user is `admin` and password `quest`\n",
